Hello!

Welcome to our Stock Exchange Program!

The main.rb file is already set with a specific client, Ben. You can look at his stock decisions and judge whether he made wise choices.

The user_input.rb file takes user input to create a new client, new portfolios, and new stock purchases, but it loses some functionality from the main.rb file.

The testing element was, upon Phil's suggestion, largely ignored.
